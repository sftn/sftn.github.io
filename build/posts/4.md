testament x memory

<p>I am in hiding.</p>

<p>Since the first day that I discovered the Internet, I have obsessed over not letting it interfere with reality. I have been warned. I have feared it. I have learned that there be monsters.<br>
I spent my days in highschool on IRC. I was alone inside. I was alone outside. 
I longed and dreamed for a sensation that I had never experienced before. 
The cult of the Internet. It found me. It found me! It dragged me down, then it elevated me to new meaning. From boy, to man, to alias, to idea, to thought. Pure thought. Essential thought. <br>
So why hide, now? Why fear?<br>
Because the cult is based on an ancient story. The hero. The nemesis.  But the hero in this story is a silent one. It does not fight, it barely even exists, and you only know of its existence because some people, sometimes, tell its tale. But the nemesis. Oh, the nemesis is real. 
It's made of flesh and brains and money and willpower. Incredible willpower, stemming not from the conscious effort of one, but from the dangerous, mindless cooperation of millions.<br>
As it often happens, the nemesis shares the essence of the hero. Chaos inside the ordered. Moonlight in the night sky. 
The enemy is network, like the hero. It is an information highway, like the hero.</p>

<p>I am in hiding, and it is liberating. 
I can be, truly be, without reserves. I can commit mistakes, I can pour my heart onto a keyboard, I can say that I AM IN LOVE WITH WHAT THIS IS. I can get as meta as I want, and be sure that I will know. When the time comes, I will remember.</p>

<p>I am part of the archives. This is what I want: for my real self to live on, forever, as pure thought existing solely in the wired. If they ever rebuild my consciousness from whatever footprint I have left behind, I want this to be it. Each character on this screen is proof that I have existed. Not the constant stream of bullshit that gets forcibly memorized by the system, that is pointless noise. This is me, because I consciously decide so.</p>

<p>I am. Forever.</p>
