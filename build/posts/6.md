mirror

<p>I walked after the rain had fallen.<br>
The asphalt was wet<br> 
it shined of halogen light.<br>
The night was calm.<br>
Just me, no questions, no noise.<br>
The celestial was below<br>
the cement was above.<br>
I felt alone in the world.<br> 
No thoughts.<br> 
I allowed myself to lose, without judgement or hate.<br> 
May green stars and red comets be witnesses <br>
to my whispered defeat.<br>
No one knows the anguish.<br> 
It is mine.<br>
I long for something that evades me,<br>
day after day after day.<br>
I want to cry again.<br>
I want the rain to take me away.<br>
I want to embrace the void and forget.<br>
Where have I been?<br>
Will I ever be back?<br>
I'll roam the night. The black night.<br>
If I walk forever, nobody will ever hurt me<br>
in the night<br>
the reflection of my soul in a puddle.<br></p>
