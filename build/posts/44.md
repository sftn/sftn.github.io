anger
Why does the revving not stop? Caged in happines I think about the war and anger keeps me awake. Ungrateful 
little fuck. Why does the calm of success not capture me? I must see them not smile and recognize that I did it 
despite them. To spite them. Middle of the pack no-name-no-brain-no-brand-no-looks-no-pedigree turned 
shark-made-cash-made-name-made-headlines. I have made it all the same. No rest until the 
gods lie face down in the dirt past which I stepped towards the summit. Then rest. Grab it all. Then rest.
