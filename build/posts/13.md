for the people of the deep
I am exhausted by the constant buzzing of words. Shallow opinions expressed with such violence, such indignation, such confidence.
The comments section is the death of originality. The feed is the death of nuance. 

I feel it to the sides of my head, like tinnitus. Logging off does not help, my mind is so addicted to the dopamine that it is impossible for me to stay away. 

I read things in their voice. Every sentence that my brain speaks, it speaks with the tone of some petulant enraged asshole in America.
I think about them when I write, read, fuck and code. They have infected my mind as if madness was a fucking virus.

I stare down the feeding frenzy of microblogging, knowing that it is my duty to participate in it (success is tied to it) and disgusted by it at the same time. I stare, exhausted. 

I think about family at night. I imagine a large, grass-covered field and the sun shining upon big animals. I see ants walking up the bark of an old tree and I imagine the world from their perspective. All the bullshit is left outside. 

I write alone, at night, knowing that none of them will ever read a word of what I write. Can you imagine, the freedom? Not a single comment will ever be made about these words. I will not have to sell the content of my fucking soul with an upbeat quirky announcement.

These words are meant for the people of the deep. These words are a nameless projection of my pure, truest soul. 
If you find them, know that this connection between us is as pure and as unfiltered as is can ever possibly be. If you find these words, I send you nothing but love.
