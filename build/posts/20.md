trains
Trains let you be immobile while everything else around you storms by at three hundred kilometers per hour.<br>
When you look at their tracks, they seem to meet in the end. Even if, really, they don't.<br>
In train stations, people are confined to a predetermined space and the rest is the realm of the machinery.<br>
You get on, and a lulling noise envelops you. After a while, you get to be in the arms of someone who loves you. It's not unlike being born.<br>
I like to watch all the couples crying at the station, because one of the two has to go away. There is true, unapologetic passion suspended in those tears.<br>
The first time I knew to be in love, she had to get off while I had to stay on. After many years, it was another train that brought me back to her. 
A perfect mechanical concert orchestrated to bring us from crucial moment to crucial moment.<br>
The collective human experience of sitting in silence, powerless, thinking about the girl of your life, or the job interview that you did not pass, or the funeral that just disrupted your existence.<br>
