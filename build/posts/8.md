<p>Messiah, tell me.<br>
Am I on a moral pathway?<br>
Am I destined to nihil?</p>

<p>Answer, Son of Truth.<br>
Is it possible to elevate oneself?<br>
Is it arrogant to try?</p>

<p>I must know, Great One.<br>
Is sacrifice the answer?<br>
Is self-preservation hate?</p>

<p>Please, Omnipotent.<br>
Is it true that happiness<br> 
is you?<br>
Is it true that you<br>
reside<br>
in us?<br></p>
