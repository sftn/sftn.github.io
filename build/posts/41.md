update
The panic attacks have been back, in a new way, or maybe the old way but more refined, less violence and more overdrive.
A constant mental exploration of the Tree of Possibility, looking for fear in any of the myriad paths and then backtracking, over and over again, running simulations in my brain of what would be if that would be if that would be and so on.
Sending beacons of doubt up my brain as soon as I wake up, testing the stability of resolutions conquered painfully through the tormented night that just passed.

The imposition of this hurricane of doubt upon my loved ones, trying to make them stumble, resenting them for not understanding as fully as I understand the complexity of the situation.

Forcing her to concede her defenses, delicate creature, after months spent helping me through the chaos. Forcing her to be exposed, sacrifice herself in the central room of my Temple of Indecisiveness. Then, destroying her trust not twelve hours later because of money or fame or whatever it is that drives me.

You'd think this all mattered in some profound way, but it doesn't. That's the most painful part. It's not some honorable cause. It's a won cause, I've won the battle, I've won the war, I will have whatever I asked for whatever I end up choosing. This is me being greedy and disgusting, the price being the happiness and quiet of the thing that most loves me. 

I don't expect you to understand. This stopped being a public stream a long time ago. I now mostly talk to myself, so that I will remember while I live and so that my corrupted soul will live on. 

Committing this string to the collective memory is my punishment and atonement for my sins against purity.
