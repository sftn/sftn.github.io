Image generators have died in the span of two years.

We went from 16 by 16 pixel blobs of tiny birds, to uncanny faces and lots and lots of animals, to the wild excitement of text-to-image finally working. I remember running prompts for my friends who did not yet have beta access, feeling optimistic about technology for the first time since the 2000s, running out of quota fast fast fast and having to wait for credits the next day, a burning laptop GPU at full utilization. Such an easy negotiation between the creative mind the talentless mind-carrier, such power to deepen one's sense of aesthetics.

It's gone now. Feeling nostalgia for something that occurred not two years ago must be the peak nightmare of the all-consuming 2020s. 

Creativity was automated, packaged, patented, protected by Community Terms of Service, monetized, sterilized, put on slide decks for board meetings, made safe, made innocuous. The metrics have never been so high and the results have never felt so empty.

I guess it was foolish of me to entrust my optimism, or really any form of positive emotions, to the hands of the Corporate Memphis devourer.
