Checking in my new apartment complex. The place reeks of premium mediocrity although the decay of [MEGACITY] makes it feel luxurious by comparison. 

I wait, as the guard logs my data into the system so that I may be tracked and reachable at all times. All emails from the system have CAPS LOCK SUBJECTS to highlight their urgency.

I lock eyes with a woman a few steps away from me. She looks at my badge, I still have it on me because I just got off from work at [CORP]. 

I answer a question from the guard. The woman is still looking at my badge. I smile. She shows me her own [CORP] badge. 

We are both from [COUNTRY]. We switch language, she tells me that she's head of a [CORP] internal network of [COUNTRY]ans. 

The next day I join the network. It's dead. I never hear from her again.

Just another soul who dragged itself to [MEGACITY], because [CORP] is here and not in [COUNTRY], and success is 
paid with loneliness and transitory exchanges in a sterile lobby.
