Checking in my new apartment complex in [MEGACITY]. The place reeks of premium mediocrity although the decay of [MEGACITY] makes it feel luxurious by comparison. 

I wait, as the guard logs my data into the system so that I may be tracked and reachable at all times. All emails from the system have CAPS LOCK SUBJECTS so that you may understand their urgency.

I lock eyes with a woman a few steps away from me. She looks at my badge, I still have it on me because I just got off from work at [EVILCORP]. 

I answer to a question from the guard. The woman is still looking at my badge. I smile at her. She smiles back, shows me her own [EVILCORP] badge. 

We initiate the typical handshake sequence to establish rank, civil status, wealth, nationality. We are both from [COUNTRY]. We switch language, she tells me that she's head of an [EVILCORP] internal network of [COUNTRY]ans. 

The next day I join the network. It's dead. I never hear from her again.

Just another soul who dragged itself to [MEGACITY], because [EVILCORP] is here and not in [COUNTRY], because success is paid with loneliness and transitory exchanges in an aseptic lobby.
