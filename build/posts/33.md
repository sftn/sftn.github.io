comfort

I plug an old HaloSim cartridge into the deck to relive the moment.

On. Walking through a Pachinko joint in central Tokyo, mind slightly clouded by rice beer and not having spoken a single word for days, leading to a pink-neon orgy of claw machines and then to the next, tunnel after tunnel, piercing the plastic carousel of blank-stare-automata.

Off. There is comfort in the room of the manchild youtuber. The theatrical arrangement of consumerism and color reminds me of a time when I could feel passion for the frivolous and that now, as I scroll past it, I need not care of what dwells in the American-dystopian post-collapse sprawl outside of those 1080 rows of pixels so colorful, so consumerist, so genuinely modern.

Tunnel after tunnel scrolling by.
