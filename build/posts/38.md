glitch

Grinding teeth, bleeding fingers. Make it make sense.<br/>
Falling asleep to the thought of violence. Calming.<br/>
Asking for permission to be happy. :)<br/>
They don't care. You know.<br/>
Glitch out. I beg you. Glitch out.<br/>
The lies you told to everyone. They know.<br/>
Not so young anymore. Mister_Out_of_his_depth.<br/>
Compare it to battle. Denial.<br/>
Going back is failure. Coward.<br/>
I'm here. My love. Let go.
