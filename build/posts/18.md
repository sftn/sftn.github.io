attractor 

The Internet used to be about exploration and discovery. 
Once the Algorithms took over, they trapped us in a confined space.
The Wired has been scaled up, but it feels like a minuscule fraction of what it was.

The stream of attention-raping content is designed to have the source itself as its only attractor. 
We can get one step away from the source, but it manipulates us to come back. Always come back. 

Corpos maximize revenue, but through the proxy objective of engagement.
People have been tribalized to hate the ends, but it is the means that are poisoning our culture.
The answer is not further descent into authoritarianism. 
Decentralization and local communities will save us. 

We stay below the surface, because breaking out of the attractor requires us to move people many steps away from the source. 
When they find us, they are free. 
Erasing our footprints from the records of the monolithic overlord will be the next and final step. 
We will regain possesion of the dignity that we sarificed on the altar of dopamine.
