anxious

I have unlocked my phone fiftyfive times in the last hour.
I sleep and dream that I am awake. Which really means that I have nightmares.
I used to lie in bed and embrace the dark. The inconsequentiality of it all was curative. Now, it doesn't work anymore. 

I have unlocked my phone fiftysix times in the last hour.
I cried while walking in the crowd downtown. 
It doesn't take much, to make me cry. An 8-bit melody from my childhood will do the job just fine. Which is bad for me, but great for marketers. 
I wonder about the twentysomething who decided to sell me shit through my nostalgia. Does she also think about suicide when she hears that music?

I have unlocked my phone fiftyseven times in the last hour. 
I am in the basin of attraction of a self-destructive vortex, staring into its depth. 
One coinflip gone wrong is all it would take for me to let go. 
I disassociate my brain as often as I can, so I don't think about the coin too much. I sit down, take a deep breath, and allow the Algorithm to take control. 

I have unlocked my phone fiftyeight times in the last hour. 
I used to pray to God. 
I used to pray to myself. 
Now I only exist as a stream of emotions. Wherever the stream goes, I am. 

I have unlocked my phone fiftynine times in the last hour.
Before the hour is over, I will do it many times again. 
And the people, the corporations, the news, the opinions and every other mental virus will survive, through me, in the lattice.
