summer
I am on the boundary of collapse in a way that I have never been before. 
The sequence of events: I received an email, the only remaining lifeline to my professional success shattered, I consoomed Stranger Things, I hugged my girlfriend tight, I went to bed, hot, I thought about grandma, I thought about the future, I felt tears collecting to the sides of my eyes, I pretended in the dark that all was fine, I said goodnight, I cried silently because I could not let her know that I am hurting, I tried to understand the situation, to rationalize all that has happened in the past six months, I thought about the responsibilities of a man and what it means to be alive in this world, killing myself and how all of them would react, I had a song stuck in my mind, today I pretended to work even though I know that it is hopeless, I went on Youtube, played the song, I surprised myself by crying again, smoked a cigarette, then another, then ate unhealthy food, all the while damning myself for what I am doing to myself, I thought about going bald, people thinking that I am 5 years older than I really am, I tried, I swear, I tried, and it's all amounted to so little, a life of efforts leading to the realization that I am not enough, not enough, not enough, not enough. 
I am defeated by life and I see no way out. 
I thought I could find a way but I cannot.
I would ask for help but I cannot.
I would kill myself but I cannot.
I go blindly towards nothingness, knowing that years of shame and failure await me. 
I think of my ancestors and how I've failed them. 
I see no way out.
