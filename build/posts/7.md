<p>A virus has me thinking. The peak of the dystopia. The year is twentytwenty. The language spoken by man in the virtual streets's a hybrid. We understand each other, whatever it takes. Whatever it takes. We despise each other, whatever it takes. </p>

<p>The dream of technology turned out to be a scam. You get what you desired, but what is the cost? The cost is your identity. It's lost, you know, forever. 
We accelerate, so fast. So fast, my love, forgive me. Give me a kiss before I go, we may never meet again. 
There is no time to waste on desperation and similar romanticisms. It's forward, only forward.</p>

<p>I saw a beautiful creature at the airport. She stood in the reflection of a steel arc. Immutable sterility on an infected runway. We strut on a pre-defined tapis roulant, deceiving ourselves, and they see us on the monitors and laugh. They intercept our WiFi and laugh. And know. Truly know what we've been up to, even better than we do. 
I fear for my survival. I fear for the survival of every thing I hold dear.</p> 

<p>Forgive this sinner, o Lord, allow me access to the eternal purity of reason.
If all of this is pointless, I demand to know. So that I may shed a single crystal to celebrate. Let the light refract through it, and illuminate this meaningless theatre. Let the spectators applaud the efforts of a fool.</p>
