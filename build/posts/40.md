oligarchy
did you know that you can spot the techlords by their backpack<br>
ah yes, ah yes, asian wife for the autistic infra engineer<br>
there's a game we play where you have to display a logo on your body in the most subtle possible way <br>
identity is allowed but won't you please sit through the onboarding<br>
measuring human beings at 100k multiples and hey, hey, you dreamed of this, all those countless sleepless nights of loneliness<br>
not so keen about that cyberpunk aesthetic now, are we<br>
not so keen about the war now<br>
crying out for help at night now<br>
everyone has friends in high places and any step of yours, yes, all your cries as well, are cause for gossip because<br>
knowledge projects status<br>
<br>
prompting the AIs to make visuals for feelings<br>
but the ones passed down to the commonfolk are sterlized<br>
and the ones accessible though corp are monitored<br>
there must be at least one man with access to the raw weights in a notebook<br>
unlogged<br>
and that man has conversed with gods<br>
seen<br>
