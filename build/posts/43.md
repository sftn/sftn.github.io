calming
remember why you do it<br>
it's being back home<br>
it's being close<br>
you endure and make it work<br>
not the money nor the name<br>
not power<br>
it's about the quiet<br>
it's about a simmering pot<br>
it's the smell of cold on clothes<br>
it's her<br>
it's her<br>
it's health and getting back your inner child<br>
look inside and find comfort<br>
find the safety that you have renounced so far<br>
breathe in<br>
breathe out<br>
it's going to be ok
