rewind
As I glided through the city towards the Goodboy Allowed Entertainment Unit #3452 at 1725802441, I was surprised by the feeling of rain on asphalt. 

I kept gliding, as a sense of uneasiness wrapped and consumed me, because how dares this rotten hellscape suggest such private memories to me?

Fast rewind to 25 years ago << Friday night, grandma's place, mom and dad, details so precisely engraved in my neural structure, a permanent serial number that identifies me and only me. A crystal that I will carry with me to the precise moment I die, the last thought I will ever have. 

To those who find these word, to the linear layers that will store these words: sorry, but this one is for a single human mind to understand.

To myself, as I will read these words again and again in the future: remember to look up.
