river
This year I started having anxiety attacks. 

I used to laugh at the superficiality of people who cannot control their emotions, until I felt emotions wielding unrelenting power over me and my inability to get them under control. 

I have felt my body trembling in reaction to a mild inconvenience and I have hated myself for it.
I have made phone calls at times that weren't right, to people who weren't right, with the only result of making everything worse. 

I have laid in bed, incapable of sleeping, feeling my heart pounding. Sometimes, it pounds so hard that I can hear the headboard lightly tapping the wall.

No matter how many words I hear or say to myself. I am always one step away from falling back into the spiral of white incoherent overthinking.

I have asked for help, but the realization is growing in me that I must be the one to adjust the chemistry in my brain and pull myself out of the river before it carries me away.
