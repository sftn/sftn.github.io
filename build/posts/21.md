eyes
dystopian vaporwave moment on the subway<br>
phone background, an image of his son<br>
eyes covered by the google search bar

why the eyes<br>
why the eyes<br>
to hide from them what we've become<br>
shame<br>
to protect us from their memory<br>
weak<br>
to not think about it<br>
ego

they're symbols<br>
they're symbols<br>
the statue, the child<br>
a lifeline to a past we're not fully sure<br>
existed<br>
but certainly exists<br>
in our desperation<br>
