war

<p>Everyday I prepare myself for war.<br>
I harden the body and the mind because I know that conflict is upon us. The tribe will prevail over the lies that we have been telling ourselves. We strive, secretly, for a return to the Origin. The Ape within us requires that we sacrifice other apes, so that it can feed. By feeding it, we return to Mother.</p>

<p>Do not fear the advent of violence, as it will only hurt those that hypocritically live in the comfort of urbanoid fetishism and commercial opining. Towards those that see through the filth, violence will be benevolent. For those that respect it, violence will reserve the gift of freedom. To those that partake in it, violence will give eternal glory. It is our prerogative to choose the degree to which we embrace violence.</p>

<p>Do not fear, but think of what will come after.<br>
What are the ideals on which we build civilisation? Where have the heroes gone, and how do we get them back?
The battle cry of our deconstructed generation will inspire the ages. "For the tribe!" "Hail Nature!" "Ad Homines!"
The rubble of the conflict shall be used to erect a wonder. Prepare for war.</p>
