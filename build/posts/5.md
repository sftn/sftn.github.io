<h3>1_factotum</h3>

<p>If you’re going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don’t even start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision. It could mean mockery — isolation. Isolation is the gift. All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And, you’ll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. If you’re going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It’s the only good fight there is.</p>

<h3>2_bluebird</h3>

<p>
there's a bluebird in my heart that<br>
wants to get out<br>
but I'm too tough for him,<br>
I say, stay in there, I'm not going<br>
to let anybody see<br>
you.<br>
there's a bluebird in my heart that<br>
wants to get out<br>
but I pour whiskey on him and inhale<br>
cigarette smoke<br>
and the whores and the bartenders<br>
and the grocery clerks<br>
never know that<br>
he's<br>
in there.<br>
<br>
there's a bluebird in my heart that<br>
wants to get out<br>
but I'm too tough for him,<br>
I say,<br>
stay down, do you want to mess<br>
me up?<br>
you want to screw up the<br>
works?<br>
you want to blow my book sales in<br>
Europe?<br>
there's a bluebird in my heart that<br>
wants to get out<br>
but I'm too clever, I only let him out<br>
at night sometimes<br>
when everybody's asleep.<br>
I say, I know that you're there,<br>
so don't be<br>
sad.<br>
then I put him back,<br>
but he's singing a little<br>
in there, I haven't quite let him<br>
die<br>
and we sleep together like<br>
that<br>
with our<br>
secret pact<br>
and it's nice enough to<br>
make a man<br>
weep, but I don't<br>
weep, do<br>
you?<br>
