ghost
There is a fine thread that keeps me connected to the past. One needs to maintain this thread, care for it, because once the thread snaps, the past is gone.<br>
One needs to carefully copy every picture, every text file, every music file from one device to the next, then to the next, then to the next, then to the next, forever. There is no mercy for those who stop copying. It takes one moment of careless stupidity for it all to be gone. One "I'll do it later" too much.<br>
The cosmos itself conspires against you. The an-entropic arrangement of my life's memory, mind you, my ghost itself, is unbearable to the chaotic impulse of God.<br>
The happy memory, drowned by the daily overstream of eyeball-defiling mental clamps, the memory, I mean, cannot survive unless you embark in the unconscious mechanical effort of encoding it, copying it, verifying its integrity year after year after year. You need to trust that the process itself is enough, that as long as you carry on the ritual, your ghost will survive. 
The thread, which, come to think of it, is a vessel that carries the meaning of one's life -- for what meaning can there be if the context is lost? -- must be tended to. Always. <br>
The people that are part of the ghost will themselves vanish, at some point, meaning that the ghost will soon be more real than the people themselves. What a responsibility. <br>
To bring forward an arrangement of electrons, really just a pattern, fighting against God itself just so that one's life can be made whole, at the end, even if nobody else cares.<br>
Is it selfishness? Is it fear? <br>
I only know that, without it, I am scared. Without it, I spiral and spiral into a black hole, until there is nothing else but my own selfish singularity, devoid of meaning. <br>
I know that, soon, I will curse myself for not putting enough energy into the process. I will look back and it won't have been enough, the corruption of the data will be too much to recover the ghost. And I will be gone, hopefully having left enough of a trace that I, too, will become part of someone else's ghost. Such is the nature of humans.
