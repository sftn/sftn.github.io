goals

more and more productive brings me 
farther and farther away from
you and you wait for me to
return and stay return and stay

at night I grasp the void and ask
and say
it's worth it is it worth it
alas there's no one there

I've lived this dream so many times oh
so many tiny steps and games 
the feel of grass beneath my gaze
a dog a cloud a fire the smell of ink 
cinnamon cake

I've closed the door too many times too 
many years behind my back 
and every time a whispered curse to God
but really to my self
