goals

more and more productive brings me<br>
farther and farther away from<br>
you and you wait for me to<br>
return and stay return and stay

at night I grasp the void and ask<br>
and say<br>
it's worth it is it worth it<br>
alas there's no one there

I've lived this dream so many times oh<br>
so many tiny steps and games <br>
the feel of grass beneath my gaze<br>
a dog a cloud a fire the smell of ink <br>
cinnamon cake

I've closed the door too many times too <br>
many years behind my back <br>
and every time a whispered curse to God<br>
but really to my self
