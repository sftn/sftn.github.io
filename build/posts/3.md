courage

<p>I saw a girl browsing the web without an adblocker. </p>

<p>A 4K monitor, mostly full of advertisements.</p>

<p>I wanted to tell her that a better way exists, but who am I to give advice?</p>

<p>I asked myself: "Is that what efficiency looks like?"</p>

<p>What else does she do, that I lack the courage to even imagine?</p>
