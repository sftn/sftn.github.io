fight back
I have been led to believe that resistance to the futile is futile. 
But I know, a thought that I have kept hidden in the deepest trench of my heart, that I am not the child of an absurd worldview. I search for meaning, constantly, because I do not subscribe to the paid subscription model. I am not content with being the least amount of entropy necessary to identify me in the cyber-dystopia. To own me. 
To those that know: come find me in the bytestream.
To those that want me to forget: I see you. I know you. I am essential. Fuck you.
